1. DFS and BFS for 8-Puzzle Problem
•	8-Puzzle: A sliding tile puzzle aiming to reach a goal state.
•	BFS: Explores level by level, guaranteed to find the shortest path.
•	DFS: Explores depth-first, using less memory but may not find the shortest path.
2. Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)
•	CSP: Solves problems with variables, domains, and constraints.
•	Example: Sudoku, where constraints ensure no repetition of numbers in rows, columns, or grids.
3. Parsing Family Tree Using Knowledge Base
•	KB: A collection of facts and rules used to infer relationships like parent, child, and sibling in a family tree.
4. A* Algorithm
•	A*: Combines actual cost (g) and heuristic (h) to find the most efficient path. It is optimal if the heuristic is admissible.
5. Minimax Algorithm
•	Minimax: Used in game-playing AI to minimize the possible loss by assuming the opponent plays optimally.
6. 8-Queens Problem with Basic Search
•	8-Queens: A problem of placing 8 queens on a chessboard where no two queens can attack each other.
7. Forward Chaining Algorithm
•	Forward Chaining: A rule-based inference method that starts with known facts and applies rules to reach a conclusion.
8. Backward Chaining Algorithm
•	Backward Chaining: A rule-based approach that starts with the goal and works backward to find supporting facts.
9. Chatbot Application
•	A chatbot simulates human conversation for tasks like customer support. It uses natural language processing (NLP) for real-time responses.
